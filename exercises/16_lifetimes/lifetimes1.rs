// The Rust compiler needs to know how to check whether supplied references are
// valid, so that it can let the programmer know if a reference is at risk of
// going out of scope before it is used. Remember, references are borrows and do
// not own their own data. What if their owner goes out of scope?

// TODO: Fix the compiler error by updating the function signature.
// The function should return a reference to the longest of the two string slices.
// The returned reference must be valid for the lifetime of the shorter of the two
// string slices.
// You can use the lifetime annotation `'a` to indicate that the returned reference
